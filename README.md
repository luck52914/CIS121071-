2Critical Appraisal of a Systematic Review: A Checklist*GuideCommentsAre the results valid?1. Did the review address a focused question?2. Were the criteria used to select articles forinclusion appropriate?3. Is it unlikely that important, relevant studieswere missed?4. Was the validity of the included studiesappraised and were the studies ofreasonable quality?5. Were the assessments of the includedstudies reproducible?6. Were the data extracted appropriately?7. Were the results similar from study tostudy?What are the results?1. What are the overall results of the review?2. How precise are the results?Will the results help me in the context in which I am interested?1. Can the results be applied to my subjects?2. Were all clinically important outcomesconsidered?3. Are the benefits worth the harms and costs?*This checklist was created from information contained in the Oxman et al (1994). For moreinformation on issues to consider for each of the guide points you need to refer to this paper.
3Tutorial 11–Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisQuestion 1What advantages does a meta-analysis have over the results of a single study?What advantages and disadvantages does a meta-analysis have over a systematic review without ameta-analysis?Question 2Figure 1 is taken from a (fictitious) systematic review and meta-analysiswhichidentified allpublished studies that compared cardiovascular risk factors between shift workers on a forwardrotating roster and permanent day-shift workers.In regard to Figure 1:(a)What do the box and the lines for each study indicate?(b)Why is the box for Study 2 so much bigger than the boxes for the other studies?(c)What does the diamond indicate (in general, not specifically in this study)?(d)Summarise the results of the systematic review and meta-analysis, as shown in Figure 1.Figure 1:Relative risk of being diagnosed with high cholesterol in workers working on forwardrotating shift rosters compared to day-shift workers.StudyWeighting1.01.4Study 1Study2Study3Study4Study50.150.650.050.100.05Relative riskI2= 35%
4Read the INTRODUCTION and METHODS sectionsand the ‘Strengths and Limitations’ partofthe DISCUSSION section inthe Johns and co-workers(2014)paper(Diet or exerciseinterventions vs combined behavioral weight management programs: a systematic review andmeta-analysis of direct comparisons.Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics2014;114:1557-1568).The paper can be accessed through the Reading List on Canvas or by searching the library’s ejournals.Note: You do NOT need to look at the rest of the paper unless you want to.Definitely don’t spendtime looking in detail at Table 1.Question 3There are several forest plots in the Johns and co-workers (2014) article (Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7).Look at Figure 7.a)What do the I2andpvalues (shown on the left-hand side)mean?b)Do you think it is reasonable to combine the estimates from the different studies into asingle meta-analytic estimate as has been done in the study? Why or whynot?c)What is your interpretation of Figure7?Question 4Conduct a critical appraisal of the methods of the paper by Johns and co-workers(2014). To helpwith this, you should refer to the article by Oxman and co-workers(1994) (the reference detailsare shown on Page 1–again, the paper can be accessed through the reading list on Canvas or bysearching the library’s e-journals), and the checklist (Page 2).ONLY ANSWER QUESTIONS 1 TO 7OF THE CHECKLISTUNDER THE HEADING “ARE THE RESULTS VALID?”.a.What are the strengths/weaknesses of the meta-analysis that make it particularly good orbad?Overall, do you thinkthe methods suggestit is a goodreview?b.Read the potential conflict of interest statement on the last page of the article. Whatcontribution (if any) does this make to your criticalappra​​​​
